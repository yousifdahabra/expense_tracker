# Project Title

Expense Tracker

## Description

You can store your daily transactions, whether they are expenses or income, to keep track of updates with a live report. This is built using HTML and CSS for the design, and JavaScript to implement the entire logic.

## Update

After the update, users can securely store their data in the database, allowing each user to access their transactions without relying on local storage, which may be cleared over time or when the browser is reset
